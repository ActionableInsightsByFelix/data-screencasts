# Code from screencasts of #tidytuesday

These are the R Markdown documents produced during live analyses of [#tidytuesday data](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).

I've released two screencasts so far:

* [College Major and Income](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx5yhXAQLxw&t=53s) (2018-10-16)
* [Horror Movie Profits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-DRwg9yeNA) (2018-10-23)
